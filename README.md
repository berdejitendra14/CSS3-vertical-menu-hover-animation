# CSS3-vertical-menu-hover-animation
Pure CSS3 Vertical menu with nice hover effect

Since the font icons come into reality they changed lots of application design patterns and become must to use factors from the last decade.

I have tried to create a simple left navigation animation panel with help of a bootstrap icon set.

Please feel free to use this prototype if you like it.

Thanks in advance.
